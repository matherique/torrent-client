## Motivation

I made this just for learning more about the UDP and TCP protocol, sockets,
buffers and dealing with this amount of calls.

In this project I made better logs, so i can see what's happening.

## Usage

To use you need to pass the .torrent file and the folder to put the downloaded
content
